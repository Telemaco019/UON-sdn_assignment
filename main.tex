\section*{Overview}
In this paper are proposed four different lab activities meant to teach how to implement
a cluster of controllers inside Mininet using some of the most common available methods.
Each activity focuses on a single method and uses it to implement a given topology.

In particular, in each activity the following methods will be explained:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Activity 1}: implement a network with multiple controllers using a python
  script and the middle-level Mininet API
  \item \textbf{Activity 2}: implement a network with multiple local controllers using a python
  script, a custom switch class and the topology classes provided by the Mininet high-level API
  \item \textbf{Activity 3}: dynamically connect the switches of a Mininet
  network to different controllers using the tool ovs-vsctl.
\end{itemize}

The paper also includes a fourth lab activity (\textbf{Activity 4}), which is a conclusive challenge meant
to let the reader test the knowledge acquired with the execution of the previous
four activities. Each activity moreover contains some final questions aimed to make the reader
reflect on what he did during that specific activity and possibly make him try to
bring minor changes to the implemented topology. The solution for the activity 4
and the answers to the questions included in the previous activities can be
found in Appendix A.

It's important to point out that all the proposed activities are meant to be
only an introduction to SDN controller clustering, therefore this paper won't cover
some of the aspects that have to be considered when implementing a cluster of
controllers in a real-world context, such as load balancing and communication
between controllers. More information about these topics can be found in references
\cite{ref-2}, \cite{ref-1} and \cite{ref-9}.
The communication between different controllers can however be automatically managed
by Mininet, the network emulator used in these paper activities. When in fact a
network with multiple local controllers is implemented inside the emulator, all
the local controllers are executed inside the kernel space on a single machine
and therefore they can communicate with each other without an external
communication mechanism being necessary.
